/* Data structure can be defined as arrangement of collection of data items so that they can be utilized efficiently(operations on the data can be done 
efficiently).This is about:-1.Arrangement of the data,and 
                            2.Operations on the data that are efficient inside the main memory during the execution of a program.Data is kept inside the 
                              main memory and the program is also in the main memory.

The data cannot be processed in the storage it has to be brought in the main memory 

The arrangement or organising of the data inside the main memory for efficient utilization by the application that arrangement is called the data 
structure.Data structure is a part of running program.

Without data structure we cannot develop any application.



Data base means arranging the data in some relational model in the permanent storage so that it can be retrieved or accessed by applications easily that 
arrangement is called database.

Algorithms written for analyzing data warehouse is called data mining algorithms. */
