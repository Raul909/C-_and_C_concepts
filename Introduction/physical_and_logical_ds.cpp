/* Types of Data Structures -->>
                               A.Physical Data Structures.
                               B.Logical Data Structures.

A.Physical ds -->>

1.Array --> Collection of contagious memory allocation.This will have fixed size.

2.Linked list -> Dynamic Data Structures(Variable length)

These are called physical data structures because these data structures define how the memory is organized or allocated.

Arrays can be created both in heap and stack memory.Whereas,Linked List are always created in the heap memory.



B.Logical ds -->>

1.Stack    //LIFO        //Linear
2.Queues   //FIFO        //Linear
3.Trees                  //Non-Linear
4.Graph                  //Non-Linear
5.Hash Table             //Tabular

These logical data structures are implemented using any of the physical data structures(arrays,linked list or combination of arrays and linked list).
