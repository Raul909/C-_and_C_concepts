2.ADT Stack


Stack works in disciplined in LIFO(Last in First Out) i.e., The last element inserted has to be deleted first.


ADT Stack
----------
ADT just gives the definition of a stack in terms of data representation and the operations that can be performed.


Data
-----

1.Space for storing elements 
2.Top Pointer




Operations
-----------
1.Push(x)   --> to push a value in the stack.
2.Pop()     --> to pop/delete/remove a value from the stack
3.Peek(index)    --> to peek a value from the stack i.e., looking for a value at a given position
4.StackTop()     --> to find the value present at the topmost of stack
5.isEmpty()      --> to check if the stack is empty or not
6.isFull()       --> to check if the stack is full or not


#We use arrays and linked list to implement stack
