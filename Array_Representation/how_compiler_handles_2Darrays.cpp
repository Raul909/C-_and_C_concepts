/* 

So basically machine code should refer the location with the addresses not by name that compiler has to convert name into an address

Address(A[i])  =  l_0 + i*size of datatype              In C,C++,where index starts from 0                       ,where l_0 = base address and i = index 

               = l_0 + (i-1)*size of datatype                In other languages where index doesn't start from 0 ,where index starts from
